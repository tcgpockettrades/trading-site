# TCG Pocket Trades

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## About
This site was created by [Camden Spehl](https://github.com/CamdenSpehl) on March 4th, 2025.

I made this project for fun, and because I think I could use it. I'm not affiliated with Nintendo, The Pokemon Company, Dena, or Pokemon TCG Pocket.

## Features
- Browse trades from other players
- Create trades with other players
- View your trade history
- Keep track of cards you're missing (this also makes creating trade offers easier since we can suggest cards you are missing)
- Have easy notifications when someone wants to trade with you

## Spam/Dead Trade Prevention
Trades will expire after 6 hours. This is because I know people will complete a trade and not mark it as complete, and I wanted an automated way to make sure trades on the site are active trades. If you don't get a trade in 6 hours, you can simply click refresh and it will be marked as active again for the next 6 hours. There is no limit on refreshing trades.

## Future Plans
If people use it, I'll add more features. I have an idea for having email or text notifications when someone hits "notify" so you don't need to check your notifications in the app.

## Reporting Bugs
If you report bugs, please send me an email at inquiry.tcgpockettrades@gmail.com, that email will forward to my personal email.
